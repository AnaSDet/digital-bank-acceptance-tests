  Scenario Outline: Negative Test Cases. As a Digital Bank Admin I want to make sure users can not register without providing all valid data
    When User creates account with following fields with mocked email and ssn
      | title   | firstName   | lastName   | gender   | dob   | ssn   | email   | password   | address   | locality   | region   | postalCode   | country   | homePhone   | mobilePhone   | workPhone   | termsCheckMark   |
      | <title> | <firstName> | <lastName> | <gender> | <dob> | <ssn> | <email> | <password> | <address> | <locality> | <region> | <postalCode> | <country> | <homePhone> | <mobilePhone> | <workPhone> | <termsCheckMark> |
    Then the user should see the "<fieldWithError>" following required field error message "<errorMessage>"


    Examples:
      | title | firstName | lastName | gender | dob        | ssn    | email  | password  | address | locality | region | postalCode | country | homePhone | mobilePhone | workPhone | termsCheckMark | fieldWithError | errorMessage                        |
